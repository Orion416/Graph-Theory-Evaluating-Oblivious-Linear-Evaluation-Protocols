# This file contains all configurable parameters for the evaluation framework.

# cryptographic assumptions. See REFERENCES.md for complete citations.

# IMPORTANT: This is a THEORETICAL PERFORMANCE PREDICTION framework based on
# complexity models, NOT an empirical measurement system. All performance

framework:
  name: "OLE Protocol Performance Prediction Framework"
  version: "1.0.0"
  type: "theoretical_model"  # Explicitly states this is NOT empirical data
  disclaimer: |
    All performance values in this framework are PREDICTIONS based on
    theoretical complexity models derived from cryptographic parameters.
    They are NOT measurements from actual protocol implementations.
    For empirical validation, real protocol implementations should be tested.

# Controls the reproducibility of simulation results.
# - "fixed": Uses fixed_value for deterministic results

random_seed:
  mode: "configurable"
  fixed_value: 42
  description: |
    Random seed controls the Monte Carlo simulation noise.
    Fixed seed ensures reproducible results for verification.
    Time-based seed provides variation across runs.

# Evaluation Weight Configurations
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Weights determine the relative importance of each performance dimension
# in the comprehensive score calculation. Weights must sum to 1.0.
#
# Each configuration represents a different application priority:
# - Baseline: General-purpose balanced evaluation
# - Comm.-Priority: For bandwidth-constrained environments
# - Comp.-Priority: For CPU-limited or real-time applications
# - Balanced: Equal weight when no factor dominates
# - Security-Priority: For high-security applications
weight_configs:
  Baseline:
    communication: 0.35
    rounds: 0.20
    computation: 0.25
    security: 0.20
    description: "General-purpose balanced evaluation"
    rationale: |
      Communication weighted highest (0.35) as it is often the primary
      bottleneck in distributed secure computation. This reflects the
      common observation that network bandwidth is more constrained than
      computational resources in typical deployment scenarios.

  Comm.-Priority:
    communication: 0.50
    rounds: 0.15
    computation: 0.20
    security: 0.15
    description: "Communication-constrained scenarios"
    rationale: |
      For bandwidth-limited environments such as mobile networks, IoT
      deployments, or cross-continental communication where minimizing
      data transfer is the primary optimization target.

  Comp.-Priority:
    communication: 0.25
    rounds: 0.15
    computation: 0.45
    security: 0.15
    description: "Computation-constrained scenarios"
    rationale: |
      For CPU-limited environments such as embedded systems, real-time
      applications, or scenarios where computational cost directly
      translates to monetary cost (e.g., cloud computing billing).

  Balanced:
    communication: 0.25
    rounds: 0.25
    computation: 0.25
    security: 0.25
    description: "Equal weight evaluation"
    rationale: |
      When no single performance factor clearly dominates the requirements,
      equal weighting provides an unbiased comparison across all dimensions.

  Security-Priority:
    communication: 0.25
    rounds: 0.15
    computation: 0.20
    security: 0.40
    description: "High-security scenarios"
    rationale: |
      For applications with stringent security requirements where the
      security margin and assumption strength are critical factors,
      such as financial or governmental applications.

# Parameters for simulating application-level performance (Table 17).
# These model a secure linear regression application scenario.
application_simulation:
  # Reference network for application testing
  reference_bandwidth_mbps: 100.0
  reference_latency_ms: 5.0

  # Execution time variance (relative standard deviation)
  # Based on typical implementation variance in secure computation frameworks
  execution_variance: 0.05

  description: |
    These parameters simulate application-level execution time for
    a secure linear regression workload. The execution time model
    combines communication time, round-trip latency, and computation
    time based on the protocol's complexity characteristics.
